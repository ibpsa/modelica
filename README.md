# Modelica Annex60 library

This is the development site for the Modelica _Annex60_ library and its user guide.

Instructions for developers are available on the [wiki](https://github.com/iea-annex60/modelica-annex60/wiki).

## Library description

The Modelica _Annex60_ library is a free open-source library with basic models that codify
best practices for the implementation of models for building and community energy and control systems. 
The library is developed within the Annex 60 project (http://www.iea-annex60.org)
of the International Energy Agency's Energy in Buildings and Communities Programme.

The intent is that classes of this library will be extended by implementations of 
Modelica libraries that are targeted to end-users.
Hence, this library is typically not used directly by end-users, but rather by
developers of libraries that will be distributed to end-users.
