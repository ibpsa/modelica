<p>
This library follows the conventions of the
<a href=\"modelica://Modelica.UsersGuide.Conventions\">Modelica Standard Library</a>, which are as follows:
</p>

<p>
Note, in the html documentation of any Modelica library,
the headings \"h1, h2, h3\" should not be used,
because they are utilized from the automatically generated documentation/headings.
Additional headings in the html documentation should start with \"h4\".
</p>

<p>
In the Modelica package the following conventions are used:
</p>

<ol>
<li> Class and instance names are written in upper and lower case
  letters, e.g., \"ElectricCurrent\", and may contain numbers.
  An underscore is only used
  at the end of a name to characterize a lower or upper index,
  e.g., \"pin_a\".</li>

<li> <b>Class names</b> start always with an upper case letter.</li>

<li> <b>Instance names</b>, i.e., names of component instances and
  of variables (with the exception of constants),
  start usually with a lower case letter with only
  a few exceptions if this is common sense
  (such as \"T\" for a temperature variable).</li>

<li> <b>Constant names</b>, i.e., names of variables declared with the
  \"constant\" prefix, follow the usual naming conventions
  (= upper and lower case letters) and start usually with an
  upper case letter, e.g. UniformGravity, SteadyState,
  with only few exceptions such as \"pi\" and \"h_fg\".</li>
<li> The two connectors of a domain that have identical declarations
  and different icons are usually distinguished by \"_a\", \"_b\"
  or \"_p\", \"_n\", e.g., Flange_a/Flange_b, HeatPort_a, HeatPort_b.</li>

<li> The <b>instance name</b> of a component is always displayed in its icon
  (= text string \"%name\") in <b>blue color</b>. A connector class has the instance
  name definition in the diagram layer and not in the icon layer.
  If displayed, <b>parameter</b> values, e.g., resistance, mass, gear ratio, are displayed
  in the icon in <b>black color</b> in a smaller font size as the instance name.
 </li>

<li>Packages have usually the following subpackages:
  <ul>
  <li><b>UsersGuide</b> containing an overall description of the library
   and how to use it.</li>
  <li><b>Examples</b> containing models demonstrating the
   usage of the library.</li>
  <li><b>Interfaces</b> containing connectors and partial
   models.</li>
  <li><b>Types</b> containing type, enumeration and choice
   definitions.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
The <code>IBPSA</code> library uses the following conventions
in addition to the ones of the Modelica Standard Library:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
  The nomenclature used in the package
  <a href=\"modelica://IBPSA.Utilities.Psychrometrics\">
  IBPSA.Utilities.Psychrometrics</a>
   is as follows,
  <ul>
    <li>
      Uppercase <code>X</code> denotes mass fraction per total mass.
    </li>
    <li>
      Lowercase <code>x</code> denotes mass fraction per mass of dry air.
    </li>
    <li>
      The notation <code>z_xy</code> denotes that the function or block has output
      <code>z</code> and inputs <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.
      </li>
    <li>
      The symbol <code>pW</code> denotes water vapor pressure, <code>TDewPoi</code>
      denotes dew point temperature, <code>TWetBul</code> denotes wet bulb temperature,
      and <code>TDryBul</code> (or simply <code>T</code>) denotes dry bulb temperature.
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>
  Names of models, blocks and packages should start with an upper-case letter and be a
  noun or a noun with a combination of adjectives and nouns.
  Use camel-case notation to combine multiple words, such as <code>HeatTransfer</code>.
</li>
<li>
  Parameter and variables names are usually a character, such as <code>T</code>
  for temperature and <code>p</code> for pressure, or a combination of the first three
  characters of a word, such as <code>higPreSetPoi</code> for high pressure set point.
</li>
<li>
  Comments should be added to each class (package, model, function etc.).
  The first character should be upper case.
  For one-line comments of parameters, variables and classes, no period should be used at the end of the comment.
</li>
<li>
All variables that have a physical correspondence, including physical ratios, must have a unit.
Use (derived) SI units.
Non-SI units are to be kept at an absolute minimum, and they must be declared as <code>protected</code>.
</li>
<li>
  To indicate that a class (i.e., a package, model, block etc.) has not been extensively tested or validated,
  its class name ends with the string <code>Beta</code>.
</li>
</ol>

The Modelica <code>IBPSA</code> library is a free open-source library
with classes (models, functions, etc.) that
codify and demonstrate best practices for the implementation of models for
building and community energy and control systems.
</p>
<p>
The development of the IBPSA library is organized through the
<a href=\"https://ibpsa.github.io/project1\">IBPSA Project 1</a>
of the International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA).
From 2012 to 2017, the development was organized through the
<a href=\"http://www.iea-annex60.org\">Annex 60 project</a>
of the Energy in Buildings and Communities Programme of the International Energy Agency (IEA EBC).
</p>
<p>
Many models are based on models from the package
<a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Fluid\">Modelica.Fluid</a> and use
the same ports to ensure compatibility with models from that library.
However, a design change is that models from the <code>IBPSA</code>
library do not require the use of
<a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Fluid.System\">Modelica.Fluid.System</a>
as applications in buildings often have multiple fluids with largely varying
flow rates, and therefore a global declaration is impractical.
</p>
<p>
The development page for this library is
<a href=\"https://github.com/ibpsa/modelica\">
https://github.com/ibpsa/modelica</a>.
We welcome contributions from different users to further advance this library,
whether it is through collaborative model development, through model use and testing
or through requirements definition or by providing feedback regarding the model applicability
to solve specific problems.

of the International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA).
From 2012 to 2017, the development was organized through the
<a href=\"http://www.iea-annex60.org\">Annex 60 project</a>
of the Energy in Buildings and Communities Programme of the International Energy Agency (IEA EBC).
</p>
<p>
The intent of the library is that it will be extended by
implementations of Modelica libraries that are targeted to end-users.
Major goals are
</p>
<ul>
<li>to codify best practice and to provide a solid foundation onto which
other libraries for building and community energy systems can be built, and
</li>
<li>
to avoid a fragmentation of libraries that serve similar purpose but
that cannot share models among each others, thereby duplicating efforts
for model development and validation.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Hence, this library is typically not used directly by end-users,
but rather by developers of libraries that will be distributed to end-users.
Libraries that are using the <code>IBPSA</code> library as their core, or
that are working on using the <code>IBPSA</code> as their core, include, in
alphabetic order:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The <code>AixLib</code> library from RWTH Aachen, Germany, available at
<a href=\"https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/AixLib\">https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/AixLib</a>
</li>
<li>
The <code>Buildings</code> library from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, available at
<a href=\"http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica\">http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica/</a>.
</li>
<li>
The <code>BuildingSystems</code> library from
Universit&auml;t der K&uuml;nste Berlin, Germany,
available at
<a href=\"http://www.modelica-buildingsystems.de/\">http://www.modelica-buildingsystems.de/</a>.
</li>
<li>
The <code>IDEAS</code> library from KU Leuven, Belgium, available at
<a href=\"https://github.com/open-ideas/IDEAS\">https://github.com/open-ideas/IDEAS</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The library also contains more than 300 example and validation models. For Dymola,
each of these example and validation models contains a script that simulates it and
plots certain variables of interest.

Contributions to further advance the library are welcomed.
Contributions may not only be in the form of model development, but also
through model use, model testing and validation,
requirements definition or providing feedback regarding the model applicability
to solve specific problems.
